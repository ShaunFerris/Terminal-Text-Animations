# Terminal-Text-Animations

## textanima.py

A small collection of text based animations that work in termianl for use in command line applications and interfaces.
This started as a project from "The Big Book of Small Python Projects" (By Al Sweigert: https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) for an animated progress bar and a simulated download as an application of that function. I have added some additional functions for text based animations for use in other projects and as a learning exercise.
